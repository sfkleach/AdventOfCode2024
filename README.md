# AdventOfCode2024

Repo for collaborating on the Advent of Code challenge for 2024. 

## Rules

1. Python - unless there's a good excuse.
2. Each day is a completely standalone project.
   - Just copy and paste if needs be.
   - part1.py and part2.py are main programs for the separate days
3. Packages are to be managed using poetry.
   - But by default we don't bother with it.
4. Our command launcher is `just`
   - To run part<n> use the command `just part<n>`
   - This command will print out the result and nothing else.
